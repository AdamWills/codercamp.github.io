AJ Bovaird ([@ajbovaird](https://twitter.com/AJBovaird)) will show us how to use
[F#](http://fsharp.org/) and [Fable](http://fable.io/) to create a
[React web app](https://facebook.github.io/react/) without writing any Javascript.

Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)) and Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz))
will lead a discussion about the future format of CoderCamp. Bring your ideas

we can make to the format.
