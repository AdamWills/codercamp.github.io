Nathan Jervis ([@mirhagk](https://twitter.com/mirhagk)) will show you how to humiliate your
co-workers with **git blame** and explore other git commands for spelunking through
your history.

Brian Graham ([Incognito](https://github.com/incognito)) will show you his new depedency injection 
container for Python3, "[brap](https://github.com/incognito/brap)". You will see interesting use cases 
for it such as improved testability of code as well as building features that embrace the spirit of 
object oriented programming, and lastly how it can be the central artifact for a new framework.

If time permits, we will have a round table discussion around tech topics of interest to the group.
Bring your ideas and questions that you would like to talk about.
