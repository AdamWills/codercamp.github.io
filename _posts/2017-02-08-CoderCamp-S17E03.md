Nathan Jervis ([@mirhagk](https://twitter.com/mirhagk)) will show you how to humiliate your
co-workers with **git blame** and explore other git commands for spelunking through
your history.

For the second talk, we are going to do a round table discussion around tech topics
of interest to the group. Bring your ideas and questions that you would like to talk about.
